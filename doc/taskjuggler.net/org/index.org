#+TITLE: Taskjuggler.net, Welcome !

Hi, this is taskjuggler.net. I am not [[http://www.taskjuggler.org][Taskjuggler.org]]. I am offering taskjuggler.net as a sandbox for the different possibilities of the Taskjuggler server infrasturcture.

Here is a [[file:howto-taskjuggler-supervisor-ubuntu.org][howto]] on our server setup and configuration. This server exposes the listed services and you can access them directly on the corresponding ports.

I do however maintain a Redmine plugin for Taskjuggler : [[http://www.github.com/chris2fr/redmine_taskjuggler][RedmineTaskjuggler]]. At the time of this writing I have a demo for this plugin on the website [[http://redmine.mann.fr][redmine.mann.fr]].  

A sample tj3d service is publicly available on this server. The reports are visible on port 8080 via tj3web.
