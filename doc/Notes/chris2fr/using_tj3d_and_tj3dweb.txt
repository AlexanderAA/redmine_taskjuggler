Name:      taskjuggler
Port:      55223
App type:     Custom app (listening on port)
App doc:      This installer assigns an unprivileged port on which custom software can listen.

This creates the ~/webapps/<app name>/ directory for your convenience; however, the custom application is not required to reside there.

After the installer has finished, configure your custom software to listen to the port number specified in the "port" field. If the application is configured in a website record, the front-end server proxies incoming requests at the specified URL to the assigned port.

Note: Custom applications are intended for handling HTTP traffic. If you need direct access to the port, please purchase a dedicated IP address at https://panel.webfaction.com/upgrades/ and open a support ticket to have the firewall reconfigured for the assigned port and dedicated IP address.
