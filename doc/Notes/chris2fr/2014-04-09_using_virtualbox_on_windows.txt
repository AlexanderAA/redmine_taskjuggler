Here is what I am doing now, 2014-04-09

sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data

cd /usr/share/redmine/
ruby script/rails server webrick -e production

I just installed Mysql-Server with user/password root/root

I think I have it working in c_share

I need to find the command to mount 

Instead of recompiling the kernel modules each time, I can use open-vm-tools package, or something like that.
