make_sense_of_code_git_branches.textile


Trying to make sense of the state of the code.

I have three GIT copies:

* redmine_taskjuggler
* c\redmine_taskjuggler -> has komodo project file
* n\redmine_taskjuggler

 

Here are the Branches:

* 0.1.1-alpha
* 0.1.2-beta
* architecture
* issue33
* issue35
* master

---

* chris2fr
* corrections
* issue28
* issue29
* mak
* without_version

Here are the tags
* 0.1.0-alpha.1,2,3

Here are the remotes

* naminko999, naminko999wov, origin

---
 
* upstream
