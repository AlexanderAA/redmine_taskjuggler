This is my notepad for issue 37. 
I seem to want to re-architecture my solution here a bit. 

* Here are my objects
** TJP
** CSV
** Redmine
*** Project
*** Issue
*** User
*** TimeEntry
*** Settings
** Taskjuggler
*** Project
*** Task
*** Resource
*** Booking
*** TimeEffort
** Plugin
*** controllers
    These are Redmine controllers for visiting different places of Redmine.
*** helpers
*** models
    These are ActiveRecord Models dependent on Rails and from my own creation.
**** redmine_taskjuggler_projects_controller
**** redmine_taskjuggler_teams_controller
**** redmine_taskjuggler_workloads
*** views
**** redmine_taskjuggler
**** redmine_taskjuggler_projects
**** redmine_taskjuggler_teams
**** redmine_taskjuggler_workloads
**** settings

* Here is my ideal architecture
** Redmine::Project
